# Medals-Predictor
Using data from historical Olympic games (120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results)

We'll try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

# Project steps

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.
