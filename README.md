# Medals-Predictor
We'll use data from historical Olympic games. We'll try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

# Project steps

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.

# Data
We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on Kaggle.
